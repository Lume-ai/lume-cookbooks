Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the [Lume API](https://docs.lume.ai). To run these examples, you'll need a Lume API key ([reach out to start a trial]([https://](https://cal.com/lume-ai/intro-call?date=2024-04-18&month=2024-04))). Set an environment variable called `LUME_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `LUME_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

For more information, check out the [Lume Documentation](https://docs.lume.ai) and [Lume Landing Page](https://www.lume.ai).
